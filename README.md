# SpaceBastion
In our university group project SpaceBastion, I was responsible for developing the weather and lighting systems. I created a particle-based rain system that adds atmosphere and immersion to the game world, making the environment feel more alive and dynamic. Additionally, I implemented a rotating light source that casts shifting highlights and shadows across the map, enhancing visual depth and mood.
